Answer the following in brief (2–4 sentences each):

Qns.1 What are the assumptions of linear regression?
Ans.1 Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between independent and dependent variables. It is Independent of errors.
It have No multicollinearity among predictors.

Qns.2 When should you use logistic regression instead of linear regression?
Ans.2 Use logistic regression when the target variable is categorical, especially binary (e.g., yes/no, 0/1). 
Linear regression is not suitable for classification tasks as it predicts continuous values and doesn’t constrain outputs between 0 and 1

Qns.3 What is the interpretation of coefficients in logistic regression?
Ans.3 In logistic regression, each coefficient represents the log odds change in the outcome for a one-unit increase in the corresponding feature,
holding other features constant. Exponentiating the coefficient gives the odds ratio, indicating how the odds of the positive class change.

Qns.4 What is the difference between sigmoid and softmax functions?
Ans.4 The sigmoid function outputs a probability between 0 and 1 for binary classification, while the softmax function outputs a 
probability distribution across multiple classes for multiclass classification. Softmax ensures all probabilities sum to 1.

Qns.5 Why is R-squared not suitable for evaluating logistic regression models?
Ans.5 R-squared measures the proportion of variance explained in linear regression and is not meaningful for logistic regression, 
which deals with classification, not continuous output. Instead, metrics like accuracy, AUC, F1-score, and log-loss are used.
